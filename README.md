# riff-exploration
A collection of demo functions exploring [riff](https://github.com/projectriff/riff), an OSS solution that provides Functions-as-a-Service for Kubernetes. Remember, riff is for functions.

These demos assume your riff environment is setup per Brian McClain's [riff-demos](https://github.com/BrianMMcClain/riff-demos) shell script or via the instructions found on the [riff project](https://github.com/projectriff/riff) itself.
